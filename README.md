# Computer-Science-NEA---Python-Project
**Ongoing project - This A-Level NEA project is currently being developed. Code and documentation will be updated continuously.**

**Project Overview:**
For my NEA, I am creating a game similar to UNO, which aims to introduce myre strategy to the game. I hope by the end of my project, I will create a program that elevates the gameplay experience of UNO, and provides a satisfactory experience for my users.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.13.9
- Pygame (pip)
- Windows 10 or above

**What I have learned so far:**
- Learned how to use pygame to create GUIs, buttons and labels, which will all be necessary in the final program.
- Developed knowledge in variables, subroutines, and classes
- Gained insight in planning a project, and analysis of potential limitations

**Future improvements:**
- Ensure that code is thoroughly reviewed during production
- Avoid syntax errors where possible
- Learn to think ahead and think abstractly
